# web-ui-ros2

## System Requirement
- ROS2

## Description
We provide a simple input field with a button command in vanilla JavaScript. We need this simple web UI to send data to a ROS2 node.

## Task
1. Modify the UI to enable data transmission to a ROS2 node. You may utilize any third-party software or libraries.
2. Users will provide the velocity in one axis to the input field. The robot in the turtle_sim_node should move with the provided speed in that direction.

3. Provide the code as a GitHub repository with a readable README.md file so that we can reproduce your results.
